# OpenEnergyTwin

OpenEnergyTwin is an modular, real-time platform for monitoring and controlling multimodal energy systems.
It replaces traditional monolithic control systems with a scalable architecture built on digital twins, event-driven processing, and standardized interfaces to enable interoperability, third-party extensions, and modern automation support.
The aim of the project is to make energy system operation more extensible and user-friendly for operators and developers.

The initial development of OpenEnergyTwin was funded by the German Federal Minitry of Economic Affairs and Energy and led by OFFIS - Instiute for Information Technology.
